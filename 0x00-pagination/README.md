# Pagination Project

The Pagination project is designed to teach you how to implement pagination for a dataset in a Python application. By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the concepts of simple pagination, pagination with hypermedia metadata, and pagination in a deletion-resilient manner without the need for external references.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you will be able to:

1. Explain how to paginate a dataset using simple page and page_size parameters.
2. Describe the process of paginating a dataset with hypermedia metadata.
3. Discuss how to paginate in a deletion-resilient manner.

## Requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Python version: 3.7
- Coding Style: PEP 8 (pycodestyle version 2.5.*)

## File Structure

Your project should have the following file structure:


### File Descriptions

1. `my_module.py`: This module should contain utility functions related to pagination. Make sure to include proper documentation for the module and its functions.

2. `pagination_utils.py`: This module should contain utility functions specifically related to pagination with hypermedia metadata and deletion-resilient pagination. Again, ensure to include proper documentation for the module and its functions.

3. `main.py`: The main script of the project where you can demonstrate and test the pagination functionalities.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3.7 and pycodestyle installed on your system. If you don't have them already, you can install them as follows:

```bash
# Install Python 3.7
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3.7

# Install pycodestyle
pip install pycodestyle
